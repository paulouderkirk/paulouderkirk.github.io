<p>      Above all else, the Mentat must be a generalist, not a</p>
<p>specialist. It is wise to have decisions of great moment</p>
<p>monitored by generalists. Experts and specialists lead you</p>
<p>quickly into chaos. They are a source of useless nit</p>
<p>picking, the ferocious quibble over a comma. The Mentat-</p>
<p>generalist, on the other hand, should bring to decision-</p>
<p>making a healthy common sense. He must not cut himself off</p>
<p>from the broad sweep of what is happening in this universe.</p>
<p>He must remain capable of saying: "There's no real mystery</p>
<p>about this at the moment. This is what we want now. It may</p>
<p>prove wrong later, but we'll correct that when we come to</p>
<p>it." The Mentat-generalist must understand that anything</p>
<p>which we can identify as our universe is merely part of</p>
<p>larger phenomena. But the expert looks backward; he looks</p>
<p>into the narrow standards of his own specialty. The</p>
<p>generalist looks outward; he looks for living principles,</p>
<p>knowing full well that such principles change, that they</p>
<p>develop. It is to the characteristics of change itself that</p>
<p>the Mentat-generalist must look. There can be no permanent</p>
<p>catalogue of such change, no handbook or manual. You must</p>
<p>look at it with as few preconceptions as possible, asking</p>
<p>yourself: "Now what is this thing doing?"</p>
