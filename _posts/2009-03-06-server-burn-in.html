<p>I used to burn-in new servers by having them compile MySQL from source in a loop for 24-48 hours, but let's face it, that's not much of a challenge for today's servers.</p>
<p>You know what is?  Building OpenOffice.org.<br />
<!--more--><br />
On Debian Lenny, here's the shortest path:<br />
<code><br />
# apt-get install build-essential dpkg-dev pbuilder<br />
# apt-get source openoffice.org<br />
# apt-get build-dep openoffice.org<br />
# cd openoffice.org-2.4.1<br />
# debuild -us -uc<br />
</code></p>
<p>On a Sun x4100 with dual Opteron 275s and 8GB RAM, this takes about 5.5 hours, and uses way more disk I/O and memory than a mere MySQL compile.</p>
<p>Run this 4-5 times and you can probably feel pretty safe that your server won't burst into flames at 3AM the day after you deploy it in production.</p>
