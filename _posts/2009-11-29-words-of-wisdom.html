<blockquote>I have a stack of deadlines a mile high, but I think Iâ€™m also going to sit around with a bottle and just think for a while. The thinking time is essential. At least half of all writing involves just sitting and staring into space. Letting your brain out to hunt down ideas, bringing them back all warm and bloody between its teeth.</p>
